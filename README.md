Lab Work #2. A bit of TDD.
===
Due November 22nd.

1. Test descriptions
---

Describe 3 features of your application per team member, each of them consisting of at least two scenarios of usage. Use plain text to describe your features. Try to adhere to to the format of user stories. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story

Please keep them as simple as possible, you won't be able to write a fully-functional system in this lab. You'll need to pass through some of the steps of TDD, so picking a feature that's easy to test is crucial.

2. Tests
---

Based one of your scenarios, you have to design an end-to-end test for that feature and write it using the available tools in your language. For instance, if you would take Java, an option would be to use JUnit. Describe what are the features provided by the tools.
Identify the mocks you need to use for the scenario and mock them using the corresponding libraries.

3. Actual code
---

After you have seen your test fail, write the correspoding code what would implement the feature.

4. How to do it?
---
Create a folder with the name of the project in the root of the repository. Create two folders: `test` and `src`. Write the code, commit at every significant change. Add a README file to your folder with the description of your lab. In the end, it should look like this:
    
    |- project_name\
        |
        |- README
        |- test\
        |    |- test.py
        |- code\
            |- code.py
